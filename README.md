A new adventure game I am making. It will be blocky - Minecraft Style.

The source files are not yet up.

The **UPDATE.txt** file lists the most recent public version of the game, which the SkyLords client checks for and compares it with the version of the game currently installed on the machine. If they do not match, an update message pops up.
The **UPDATE2.txt** file lists the most recent internal release of the game, which the SkyLords client checks for and compares it with the version of the game currently installed on the machine. If they do not match, an update message pops up.
